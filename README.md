# ESP32_keyboard
An ESP32-based project that turns your device into a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) keyboard and Bluetooth Serial receiver. It allows you to send text or code over Bluetooth Serial, which the ESP32 then types out on a paired device as a virtual keyboard. Ideal for wireless code input and remote typing.
